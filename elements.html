			<h1>Things you should know before adopting a dog</h1><br> <br>
			
			<h2> Are you ready for an adopted dog?</h2> <br>
			<img src="1.png"> <br>
			<br>
			<h3> Adopting a dog means adding a lovable new member to your family, but it’s also a big responsibility. Everyone in your household needs to be on board with the decision to adopt a dog and understand the commitments of time, money, and care that owning a pet entails. If you’re not sure your family is ready, consider fostering a dog first. “Becoming a temporary foster home is an excellent way for your family to learn more about pet ownership, gain first-hand experience on what works for your home environment, and see if you’re ready for a new permanent member of the family. You can think of it like a test-drive,” says Joan Harris, director of canine training and behavior at PAWS Chicago. “Some families love fostering so much that they choose to be a resource to help the shelter save more lives by continuing to foster, rather than adopting themselves.” If you are ready to bring a new dog into your lives, congratulations! These are the things you need to keep in mind as your new pet adjusts to their new family.<h3>

			<h2> Don't believe the misconceptions about shelter dogs</h2> <br>
			<img src="2.png"> <br>
			<br>
			<h3> According to the ASPCA, 3.2 million people adopt a rescue pet every year. However, a common misconception is that all shelter dogs are broken, abused, or problematic. While some have been through traumatic situations or need extra medical or behavioral care, shelter dogs are placed in a shelter for a variety of reasons. “We have happy and healthy puppies from ‘oops’ litters where people didn’t spay or neuter their pets,” says Michael Morefield, director of marketing and communications for the Arizona Animal Welfare League. “We (also) have adults that are playful, active, and love other dogs, but their family couldn’t care for them for one reason or another.” There is no feeling like the one you get as you lock eyes with a dog and know it’s “the one,” regardless of age or breed. The day you bring home a new dog is one of the most memorable days ever. <h3>

			<h2>Your dog is scared </h2> <br>
			<img src="3.png"> <br>
			<br>
			<h3> Your new pup is most likely freaking out, and that’s ok. He’s been through an ordeal, either surrendered by his previous owner, picked up as a stray, and/or separated from its mom and litter mates for the first time. Rescue facilities, while important and necessary, aren’t exactly calm, quiet places. Your new dog was probably in a run or cage, maybe with one or two other dogs in the same run with him, surrounded by even more dogs in other cages, all of them barking and howling. Then, a stranger (you) put him in a car (which may or may not be frightening in itself) and took him to another completely new place. It is an adjustment, so be sure to give your pet time to get used to the new digs. And also, look out for these 15 signs that your pup is mad at you.<h3>

			<h2> You know nothing about your dog's personality</h2> <br>
			<img src="4.png"> <br>
			<br>
			<h3>Obviously, your new dog did something to charm you or she wouldn’t be your new dog. But rescue dogs, especially older ones, can be unpredictable and even if they pass a temperament test with flying colors, it pays to be safe. Never leave your children alone with a new dog, even if you think it’s the sweetest dog in the world. Take your time getting to know your dog. Better to err on the side of caution until she’s comfortable in her new home. Not all dogs at the shelter are abused dogs and not every  one has been mistreated, but they’ve still been through trauma and can be unpredictable. </p>

			<h2> Your home should be pet-proofed</h2> <br>
			<img src="5.png"> <br>
			<br>
			<h3> Just as homes need to be child-proofed for newborns and toddlers, your house should also be free of items that could potentially harm your new pet. Common culprits to look out for are small items or toys that are easy to swallow; loose wires; medicines and cleaning solutions; and houseplants that are poisonous to animals, like lilies, sago palms, and tulips. You should also keep your new pet away from these 12 common foods that could be toxic to dogs. </h3>
			<br>

			<h2> He will need training</h2> <br>
			
		    			<img src="6.png"> <br>
						<br>
			 <h3>Even if your new rescue had a previous owner, he probably picked up some bad habits while he was up for adoption. Improper urination, chewing, jumping, and pulling on the leash are all super common behavior problems in rescue dogs (especially pups who may never have had obedience—or potty—training) but they are also correctable. Consistent training is important in establishing new habits and teaching your new rescue his boundaries and the rules of his new “pack.” Your pup also might be acting out because they aren’t getting what they want; </p>

			<br>

			<h2>He needs enough time to adjust </h2> <br>
			<img src="8.png"> <br>
			<br>
			<h3> No one should expect a new dog to see his new home and immediately feel at ease, but according to Liz Claflin, director of operations of Zoom Room dog training gyms, there’s actually a timeline you can expect your pet to follow. It’s called the 3-3-3 Adjustment Period. “It takes roughly three days for a new dog to simply get over the shock of moving homes. It takes about three weeks for a new dog to get used to his new home, all of the people in his life, and his new routine, rules, and boundaries.  Finally, it takes somewhere around three months for a dog to fully and truly settle into his new life,” Claflin explains. “At this point, he will have fully settled into the household, have a set schedule he follows and be a true member of the family.” <h3>

			<h2>She won't want to meet everyone at once </h2> <br>
			<img src="10.png"> <br>
			<br>
			<h3> You will be tempted to invite family and friends over to meet your new dog as soon as she comes home—and with good reason; she’s just so darn cute!—but don’t give into temptation. You’ll only frighten her. “It’s important that your dog or puppy has a few quiet days just getting to know you and the people who live in your house,” Claflin says. Also, make sure that children living with the dog know the proper way to approach her: No poking, prodding, picking up, or hugging until she’s more comfortable with her new family.<h3>
